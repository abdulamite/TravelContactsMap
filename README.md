The Purpose of this project is to track see where prospective students are coming from

Using this map members of the Humboldt State University Staff will be able to better identify where HSU students are
coming from and target Outreach in those areas.

This tool can also be used by students to show that though we are far away from major cities in California,
we still have a large number of students from as far down south as San Diego, and as far east as PA.
